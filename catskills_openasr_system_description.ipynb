    "* Decide on the **sample rate**. Because we initially worked with the pretrained model (Unconstrained condition), which uses 16000Hz sample rate, we stayed with 16000Hz rate for the Constrained condition (probably a mistake, as it increases parameter size for no added value).\n",

    "* Decide on the initial **learning rate**.  We chose a relatively high rate of 0.02 which is double the normal Novograd recommended starting rate of 0.01, because of use of highly augmented samples for training.\n",
